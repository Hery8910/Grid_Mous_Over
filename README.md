# Grid Mous Over
## Introduction
This repository contains a project that I developed during my free time as a student at DCI in Berlin. I believe that incorporating more opportunities like these into the school curriculum could be incredibly interesting. The inspiration for this project came from observing a similar one, and I attempted to modify it to suit my goals.

## Project Overview
I aimed to simplify the CSS as much as possible, considering my current knowledge at the time. This simplification is evident in both the CSS and HTML files. In the HTML file, you will find a plethora of buttons, reflecting my attempt to create a complex grid.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to create a sufficiently intricate grid and find a solution to a particular challenge. One of the notable challenges I encountered was implementing the hover effect. After watching the same tutorial multiple times, I finally grasped the concept I needed to achieve the desired effect for this project.

## Acknowledgments
I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed working on it. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to let me know. Thank you!
